## Fundamentals Of Image Processing Final Project
### Project Topic
Text Detection and Translation
### Project Aim
While surfing or searching the internet, we do not
always encounter sites in our native language. Just
for this reason, even though we find what we are
looking for, we unwittingly leave that site. In order
to solve this problem, I aim to perceive and
translate the text shown so that the texts written
can be understood easily.
